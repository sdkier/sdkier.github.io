            <p> This page displays the projects I have completed over the years.
                I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from <strong>UI development to mobile app development.</strong>
                I have also worked on projects in the realm of <em>cybersecurity and software engineering.</em>
                I am always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to learn!
            </p>
